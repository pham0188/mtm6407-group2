# The Desert Hum

The pulsing rhythm leads you across the dunes until the ground dips into a wide sinkhole. At its base lies a strange metallic sphere, half-buried in the sand, glowing with a deep red light. The hum vibrates through your chest as you draw closer.

Dr. Kim adjusts her scanner.  
“Captain… it’s a power core. Still active after centuries.”

With steady hands, your crew connects the core to the ship’s collectors. The desert wind howls around you, but the sphere’s energy flows smoothly into the _Star Wanderer_. One by one, the gauges climb, until the fuel tanks are full again.

As the last of the glow fades, the hum dies away. The desert falls silent, leaving only the rush of the wind. Your crew cheers, relief breaking through the heat and exhaustion—you’ve found the lifeline you needed.
