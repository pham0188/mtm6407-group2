# Machines in the Sand

You lead your crew toward the half-buried machines. Up close, the fragments form part of a massive structure—like the skeleton of an ancient factory. Strange glyphs glow faintly on the metal as if responding to your presence.

Dr. Kim’s scanner chirps.  
“Captain… these systems are still producing energy. If I can link our ship’s collectors, we may be able to siphon it.”

You give the order. Carefully, your engineers set up conduits between the humming machinery and the _Star Wanderer_. Sparks crackle across the desert as the ship’s reserves begin to climb. The sand shifts beneath your boots, but the machines remain silent, allowing the transfer to complete.

“Fuel tanks are stable, Captain,” Vance reports with a grin.  
The crew breathes a collective sigh of relief. The desert may be harsh, but its secrets have given you the power to continue your journey.
