# Sand Planet

Your ship descends through thin clouds of dust and settles onto a windswept plateau of red stone. The air outside is scorching and dry, and the horizon stretches endlessly into dunes and jagged mountains. As you step onto the surface, grains of sand whip past your visor in the howling wind.

From orbit, you saw strange metallic glints scattered across the desert floor. Now, up close, they look like fragments of vast machines, half-buried and rusted, as if they’ve been here for centuries. A faint hum drifts on the wind, pulsing in rhythm, almost like a heartbeat.

Dr. Kim squints through her scanner.  
“Captain… these structures aren’t natural. Some of them are still generating energy.”

You feel the heat pressing in, the sand shifting underfoot, and the weight of your crew’s expectations. The desert seems alive, waiting for your decision.
