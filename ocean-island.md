# Land on one of the Emerald Islands

You guide the Star Wanderer down through the atmosphere, landing on a stretch of green shoreline where the sea meets dense jungle. The air is warm and clean, carrying the calls of unseen creatures. The crew steps out onto solid ground for the first time in months, their faces lit with relief.

At first, survival is difficult. The jungle is thick, the storms are relentless, and the equipment salvaged from the ship is limited. But the islands provide fresh water, edible plants, and strange sea creatures that can be hunted or farmed. Slowly, your crew builds shelter, then tools, then a small village among the trees.

Weeks become months. The Star Wanderer cannot be repaired — too damaged by the journey and storms. But the crew adapts. They learn to craft boats from native woods, to harness energy from the storms, and to weave their own technologies with the resources of the island.

_Dr. Kim records a final log:_
“We are not going home. But we are alive. And here, on this ocean world, we will build a future.”

_The crew survives_ — not as explorers of the stars, but as the founders of a new colony.
