# Twisted Vegetation

You guide the _Star Wanderer_ toward a cluster of floating islands shrouded in glowing, twisted vegetation. As the ship hovers above one of the larger islands, the wind currents shift, making the descent tricky, but your skillful piloting keeps the ship steady.

Dr. Kim activates the shuttle bay’s scanners.
“Captain, these plants appear to store a significant amount of energy in their bioluminescent sap. If we can harvest it safely, it might be enough to supplement our fuel reserves.”

You lead a small team down to the island in the shuttle. The vegetation pulses gently beneath your touch, as if responding to your presence. Carefully, the crew extracts samples and channels the collected energy into portable fuel cells.

Lt. Vance checks the gauges.
“Captain, this will keep us going for weeks. The crew’s morale just skyrocketed!”

With the energy safely stored, you return to the _Star Wanderer_. The floating islands fade behind you as the ship rises into the violet mist, fully resupplied and ready for the next leg of your mission. The crew is relieved, energized, and more confident than ever in your leadership.
