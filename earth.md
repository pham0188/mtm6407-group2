# Contacting Earth

You decide that the safest course of action is to try contacting Earth Command before making any risky landing attempts. 

"Dr. Kim, can you boost our communication array to maximum power?" you ask your science officer.

"Already on it, Captain," she replies, her fingers flying across the control panel. "But at this distance, it will take approximately 47 minutes for our signal to reach Earth, and another 47 minutes for any response to come back."

You nod grimly. That's almost two hours of waiting, and your fuel reserves continue to dwindle with each passing minute. But the wisdom of Earth Command could be invaluable in this situation.

As the powerful transmission beam shoots toward the distant blue dot that is your home planet, you notice something unexpected on your sensors. The three mysterious planets seem to be shifting their orbital patterns slightly, almost as if they're... responding to your communications signal.

Dr. Kim looks up from her console with a puzzled expression. "Captain, I'm detecting some kind of energy feedback from all three planets. It's almost like they're trying to communicate back to us."

Before you can respond, your communications officer, Lieutenant Torres, calls out: "Captain! I'm receiving multiple signals - one from Earth Command, but also three separate transmissions coming from the planets below. The signals from the planets arrived almost instantly, which should be impossible given the distance."
