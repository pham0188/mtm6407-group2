# Send a probe Beneath the Waves

You send the probe plunging into the depths. It drifts past strange bioluminescent fish, then down into a black void so deep the ship’s scanners can barely keep track. Suddenly, the feed fills with motion — something vast is stirring.

The probe’s lights sweep across what looks like an endless wall of living flesh. A single eye the size of your ship flickers open, staring directly at the camera. The crew freezes in silence.

Before you can react, the sea erupts. A colossal ocean creature breaches the waves beneath your ship, larger than any beast ever recorded. Its massive fins create shockwaves that toss the Star Wanderer into the air like a toy. For a heart-stopping moment, you’re weightless.

“Engines online!” shouts Lt. Vance.

The blast from the creature’s strike carries you upward, past the storms, through the clouds, and back into orbit. The hull screams under the pressure, but you clear the atmosphere with momentum to spare. Fuel levels remain critical, but the push has flung you free of the planet’s pull.

Dr. Kim’s voice is shaky but steady:
“Captain… whatever that thing was… it just gave us another chance. We’re back among the stars.”

_You survive_ — thanks to the fury (or mercy) of something ancient in the deep.
