# Cloud Planet

## You set course to the Cloud Planet

You give the order.
“Helm, set course for the Cloud Planet.”

The _Star Wanderer_ breaks orbit and begins its descent into the thick purple haze. The moment you enter the atmosphere, the ship rattles violently as lightning crackles all around. The viewscreen shows nothing but endless violet mist, broken only by blinding flashes.

“Shields are holding… but barely,” reports your chief engineer, Lt. Vance.

Suddenly, the scanners clear for a moment, revealing vast floating landmasses drifting in the clouds like islands in the sky. Some are covered in **twisted vegetation** that seems to glow faintly, while others are dominated by enormous **crystal formations** jutting upward like jagged spires. The crystals pulse faintly with inner light, almost as if they are storing energy or transmitting signals through the storm.

Dr. Kim studies her readings.
“Captain, I’m detecting strong energy emissions from one of the crystal fields. That might be the source of the strange signals. It could be dangerous… but it might also be exactly what we need to refuel.”

The crew looks to you, waiting for your decision.
