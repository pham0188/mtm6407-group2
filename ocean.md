# Ocean Planet

Your ship glides into orbit above the Ocean Planet. From the viewing deck, you see endless rolling seas glittering under the light of the distant star. Vast storms swirl across the waves, and here and there, tiny emerald islands dot the horizon.  

Your scanners detect breathable air, faint traces of vegetation, and strange readings deep below the ocean surface — signals that don’t match any known natural pattern.  

The crew watches in silence. Relief mixes with unease: the Ocean Planet may be a lifeline… or a trap.
