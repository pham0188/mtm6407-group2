# Ocean Planet

Your ship glides into orbit above the Ocean Planet. From the viewing deck, you see endless rolling seas glittering under the light of the distant star. Vast storms swirl across the waves, and here and there, tiny emerald islands dot the horizon.

Your scanners confirm a breathable atmosphere and signs of plant life on the islands. But deeper scans reveal something stranger still: powerful signals rising from far beneath the ocean, patterns too regular to be natural.

Dr. Kim frowns at her console.
“Captain, this world could sustain us, but whatever’s under the water… it’s watching us.”

The crew shifts uneasily. This planet may hold salvation—or something waiting in the depths.
