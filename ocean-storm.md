# Skim the Storm Clouds

You order the Star Wanderer to dip low into the raging storm systems. Lightning dances across the hull as the crew fights to keep the ship steady. For a brief moment, your collectors fill with raw atmospheric energy — enough to spark hope.

Then the storm turns. A colossal waterspout rises from the sea and slams into the ship like a titan’s fist. Alarms scream as engines fail, and the ship is hurled down into the churning ocean below.

The last thing you hear before the bridge floods is Dr. Kim’s voice, calm but resigned:
“Captain… we flew too close.”
