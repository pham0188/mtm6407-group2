# Connection Successful!

"Dr. Kim, can you boost our communication array one more time?" you ask, determined not to give up.

"I'll try, Captain Maya, but this will drain our remaining power reserves," Dr. Kim warns as she works the controls.

The Star Wanderer's bridge falls silent as the communication beam shoots toward Earth. After what feels like an eternity, static fills the speakers, then suddenly clears.
"Star Wanderer, this is Earth Command. Captain Maya, we've been tracking your position. Status report."
Relief floods through you and your crew of twelve. You quickly explain your situation - low fuel, one landing attempt left, and the three mysterious planets.

The familiar voice of Admiral Chen comes through clearly:
"Captain, our deep space monitoring stations have been detecting unusual energy signatures from that system. Based on our analysis: Ocean Planet shows advanced water processing capabilities that could help you refuel. Sand Planet has massive energy crystal formations - those metallic structures you're seeing. Cloud Planet appears inhabited, but the radiation makes it extremely dangerous for your ship's systems."

Dr. Kim looks up from her scanner. "Captain, all three planets are responding to our Earth transmission with stronger energy signatures."
"The choice is yours, Captain Maya. We have confidence in your judgment. Whatever you discover could be groundbreaking for humanity."
Your fuel gauge blinks critically low, but now you have guidance from Earth Command.
