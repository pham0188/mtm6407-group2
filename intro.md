# The Lost Explorer

## Introduction

You are Captain Maya, commander of the exploration vessel _Star Wanderer_. After months of traveling through deep space, your ship's long-range scanners have detected three mysterious planets in an uncharted solar system.

Your fuel reserves are running low, and your crew is eager to find a place to land and resupply. Through the viewing window of your bridge, you can see three very different worlds orbiting a distant star:

**Ocean Planet** appears to be covered in vast blue oceans with small green landmasses scattered across its surface. Your sensors detect breathable atmosphere and signs of what might be vegetation.

**Sand Planet** is a desert world with towering red mountains and deep canyons carved into its surface. Strange metallic structures glint in the sunlight, suggesting this planet might not be as empty as it first appears.

**Cloud Planet** is shrouded in thick purple clouds with occasional flashes of lightning. Your readings show it has a dense atmosphere and unusual energy signatures coming from beneath the cloud cover. As you investigate deeper into the planet you discover sky island formations that are suspended in the air by the storm. These sky islands seem to be stable enough to land on. Visibility and navigation is still difficult because of the radiation that fills the atmosphere

Your science officer, Dr. Kim, looks up from her console. "Captain, we have enough fuel for one landing attempt. Once we choose a planet and land, we'll need to find resources there to refuel, or we'll be stranded."

The weight of the decision rests on your shoulders. Your crew of twelve depends on you to choose wisely.

What do you decide to do next?
