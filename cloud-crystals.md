# Crystal Field

You pilot the _Star Wanderer_ closer to the largest crystal spire, its surface glowing with a pulsing, bluish light. The ship’s shields flicker as arcs of energy dance across the crystals’ jagged edges, but the hull holds steady.

From the bridge, you can see that the crystals are arranged in a deliberate pattern, like an enormous circuit or network. The energy readings spike as you approach, causing the ship’s instruments to beep and whir erratically.

Dr. Kim leans over her console, voice tense.  
“Captain, I think I can safely channel the crystal energy into our fuel reserves. It’s risky… but it should work.”

With careful precision, you guide the ship into position. Energy arcs from the crystals into the _Star Wanderer_, humming through the hull and filling the fuel tanks. The readings stabilize, and a cheer rises from the crew as the fuel gauges climb.

“Captain, we’re fully refueled!” Lt. Vance announces, a wide grin on his face.

The pulsing glow of the crystals fades as the ship hovers away from the field, now charged and ready for the next stage of your journey. Relief and excitement ripple through the crew—you’ve not only survived the storm, but gained the resources you desperately needed.
